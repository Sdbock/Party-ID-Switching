# Visualizing-Partisan-Identification-Switching-in-the-General-Social-Survey-Panel-2016-2020
This is the replication package to the article "Visualizing Partisan Identification Switching in the General Social Survey Panel, 2016-2020" published in Socius (2021). It includes all data files and R scripts needed to recreate the visualizations in the main text, as well as the appendix. 

# How to run files
The replication package is organized as an RStudio project. After pulling all folders, first open the RStudio project file. From there, the "cleaning_data.R" script—within the "scripts" folder—should be run first. This loads, cleans, and organizes the data in order to analyze. Next, the "generating_figures.R" script loads the cleaned data generated from the "cleaning_data.R" script, and generates two figures that will be saved in the "figures" folder.
